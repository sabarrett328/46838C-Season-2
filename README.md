This is the code used for the 2015/2016 Vex Robotics competition
Nothing but Net.  We were an all girls team in Michigan and had quite a bit
of success this year.  Overall we won multiple trophies, were invited to 
the Michigan State Championships, the Create US Open, and the Vex World Championships.
The girls brought home a design award from the State Championship and the 
Amaze award the the World Championships.

This is posted here as a record of what we did that year.
